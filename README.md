Comments:

-This assignment has been very challenging as I also have a full-time developer job and I didn't have the amount of time I would like to put in it. That's why I focused on actually learning as much as I could, more than trying to nail 100% of the assignment. I have to admit that the code is a bit messy and spaghetti at some points due rushing. Besides all that, this has been an awesome experience, I really feel like I learned a lot and that makes me happy.

Floren.
